#### **Relationships**
1. **Products â†” Transactions**
    - **Type:** One-to-Many.
    - **Description:** A product can be involved in multiple transactions (e.g., multiple purchases by different customers), but each transaction is tied to a single product.
    - **Implementation:** This simplifies the relationship, as each transaction involves one product directly, without requiring a Many-to-Many intermediary.

#### **Rationale for the Simplified Design**
1. **Focused Flow:**
    - Each transaction corresponds to a single product purchase, aligning directly with the flow where the customer selects a product, proceeds to payment, and completes the purchase.
2. **Removed Redundancies:**
    - `Orders` and `OrderDetails` were removed because transactions inherently encapsulate the concept of orders. For the current use case, orders are not necessary.
3. **Integrated Customer Information:**
    - Storing `Customer_Name` and `Customer_Email` directly in `Transactions` eliminates the need for a `Customers` table while still capturing essential information.
4. **Simplified Relationship:**
    - The One-to-Many relationship between `Products` and `Transactions` directly supports the current business requirement and avoids the complexity of managing multiple products within a single transaction.
