### **Relationships**
1. **Products â†” Transactions**
    - **Type:** One-to-Many.
    - **Description:** A product can be involved in multiple transactions (e.g., multiple purchases by different customers), but each transaction is tied to a single product.
    - **Implementation:** Each transaction includes a reference to a single product, without requiring a Many-to-Many relationship.

### **Rationale for the Updated Design**
1. **Focused Flow:**
    - Each transaction represents a single product purchase and includes the delivery details, ensuring the entire flow is encapsulated in one table.
2. **Integrated Delivery Information:**
    - The `Delivery_Address` field allows capturing and managing delivery-specific details directly within the transaction, aligning with the project requirements.
3. **Removed Redundancies:**
    - No additional tables for orders or customers, as all relevant data is stored in `Transactions`.
4. **Simplified Relationships:**
    - The One-to-Many relationship between `Products` and `Transactions` remains straightforward and supports the business flow directly.
